This project models a thermoelectric heat exchanger system to be used
in engine exhaust for waste heat recovery.  It requires the additional
module properties.py in Properties.

hx.py can be thought of as the parent library.  


To do:
Clean up everything to look nicer.
Move enhancement stuff to separate file to clean up hx.py
Add enhancement stuff for impinging jet and jet arrays
Eventually add scimath.units to make it better.
